The fact remains that India is predominantly a Vedic civilization, whether one likes it or not, with a minority Muslim population. Consequently, clashes between these two groups have historically occurred. Unless both sides mellow down and accept that they can coexist peacefully without interfering in each other’s religious beliefs, tensions will continue. Historically, India has had a “Ganga-Jamuni” culture, reflecting a blend of Hindu and Muslim traditions. Yet, extremists exist on both sides who reject compromise. The future progress of India depends on creating a framework of mutual respect and compromise between these two major religious communities.

pRIplSVOfhE,@darrylnoronha5251,"The Bible teaches to love your enemies and to love your neighbour as yourself, and to bless them !!!

Matthew 5:43-44:
This passage, part of the Sermon on the Mount, is the most well-known source for this concept. Jesus says, ""You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.""

Luke 6:27-36:
This passage in Luke also emphasizes the importance of loving your enemies, including blessing those who curse you and doing good to those who hate you.

Matthew 26:52. 
""Those who live by the sword die by the sword"" is a warning, often interpreted as meaning that those who choose violence will ultimately be destroyed by it, echoing the biblical context of Jesus' words.

Broader Context:
This teaching is not about condoning their actions or becoming friends with them. It's about choosing a higher path, one of love and compassion, even in the face of adversity. 

Practical Implications:

Forgetting Revenge:
It encourages us to resist the urge to seek revenge or harbor bitterness towards those who have wronged us. 

Extending Compassion:
It means being kind, understanding, and merciful towards our enemies, even when they haven't earned it. 

Seeking Reconciliation:
While not always possible, it encourages us to seek opportunities for reconciliation and healing.

Praying for Them:
It suggests praying for the well-being of our enemies, seeking their spiritual growth and restoration. 

Why It Matters:

Transformative Power:
Loving your enemies can be a powerful force for personal transformation, allowing you to move beyond anger and resentment. 

Spiritual Growth:
It can lead to deeper spiritual growth and connection with God.

Building Bridges:
It can help build bridges of understanding and peace in our communities, even in situations of conflict.

In summary, ""loving your enemy as yourself"" is a call to choose love and compassion over anger and revenge, a path that can bring both personal and societal transformation. 

In the New Testament, during Jesus's arrest, Peter, in a moment of violence, cut off the ear of Malchus, a servant of the high priest, but Jesus immediately healed the severed ear, demonstrating his power and non-violent approach. 

Here's a more detailed account:

The Incident:
During Jesus's arrest, Peter, one of Jesus's disciples, drew his sword and struck Malchus, a servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. 

Jesus's Response:
Instead of retaliating or allowing the violence to escalate, Jesus immediately healed Malchus's ear, demonstrating his power and non-violent nature. 

""If this was my kingdom, my father would have sent more than twelve legions of angels"" is a quote from the Bible, specifically from Matthew 26:53, where Jesus is saying that he could call upon his Father to send an overwhelming number of angels to defend him, but he chose not to, as his kingdom is not of this world. 

Conclusion :
Jesus came incarnate into this world which His creation, but it is not His kingdom. The ruler of this world and human who is exiled on it, is satan (devil), who himself has been exiled here, alongwith the fallen angels (demons). He is the one who deceives humans with evil thought, when they don't share a spiritual bond with God. The minute we are lured to worldly pleasures and pursuits, we turn away from the presence of God and His spiritual guidance, and end up making blunders in our lives !

A single legion of angels is about 2000 in number. Jesus says He could have called on twelve or more legions of angels to defend Him, but He chose not to, as He had come to do His Father's will, which was the ""Salvation Plan"" for all, with His Self-Sacrifice on the cross. He paid the debt of sin which is death (whether is a drop of sin or an ocean of sin), for all of humanity, as we humans not only sin bodily but by our minds too ! 

WARRIOR OF JESUS",14/09/25 18:51
pRIplSVOfhE,@darrylnoronha5251,"Jesus's message on Love and Peace !!!

In the Bible, Jesus' message on love extended to all people, regardless of faith, nationality, or personality. He used the example of the sun rising and the rain falling on both the good and the evil to illustrate God's love for all people. 

In the Bible, Jesus taught that people should love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them. Jesus's instructions on how to treat enemies created a new standard for relationships. 

Luke 6:27-28
“But to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you.” 

Matthew 26:52
""Put your sword back in its place"" and ""all who take the sword will perish by the sword"".

John 13:34
“Love one another as I have loved you”.

Matthew 5:44-45
""Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you"".

Luke 6:27-28
""Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you"".

Matthew 5:43-48
""You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"".

1 Peter 3:9:
Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.

Proverbs 16:7:
When a man’s ways please the Lord, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.

Ephesians 4:32:
Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.

Romans 12:14, 17-19:
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse . . . Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.

Luke 23:34
And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”

Therefore please do fact checkong  before accepting such grossly distorted version of events.

And yes India benjnga n ancient civilisation, religious conversions using charity money or terror or marriages causes damage to civilisation and thanks tomafoal media people are getting more and more aware of it and hence stand against deceitful conversions. and they have every right to do so to protect and preserve and defend their heritage from these einvading conversion gangs. Other than that India or Hindu has no differences with any way of worship. Kindness is foundation of this civilisation. Ms Roy. is well known leftist and supporter of conversion gangs and her frustration at public awareness about their activities is understandable. Solution lies in giving an ear to legitimate concerns of Hindus and others ancient civilisations being damaged by conversion gangs all over the globes, many dead in pushed to museum in place of demonising them.",14/09/25 13:52

pRIplSVOfhE,@S.BKumar-z9n,"What a Pathetic Situation, the once Great Demicratic Country INDIA had fallen into now in the hands of the right wing Hindu fanatics under the leadership of Modi.!? So shocking to know that in INDIA denying basic freedom to express one's opinion and live peacefully (holding on to your beliefs) are almost impossible now! This situation to which INDIA has been pulled down and is also being pulled through currently, even questioning not only the progressive & harmonious communal fabric of the country but shattering & manipulating the very core of the precious DEMOCRATIC System & the very core of INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM to express opinions are being questioned since the Present Modi Administration came into Power in INDIA in 2014. The period before that from 2000-2014 when Modi was the Chief Minister of one of the States in INDIA named GUJARAT, where Mahatma GANDHI, the father of the NATION, who led the freedom STRUGGLE in India and won us Freedom from the British COLONIALIST! The current authoritarian style of the Modi administration was actually experimented & practiced in the State of GUJARAT during the Chief Ministership of Modi from 2000 to 2013, very similar like the one our country INDIA is now going through.... But it was confined within that one state named GUJARAT..!! That state was turned into a crucible by Narendra Modi & his lieutenants like Amit Shah to experiment & implement with his Right Wing Hindu Fanatic, Anti Muslim Ideologies & Policies, when Modi was the Chief Minister of the state of GUJARAT! The Practicing of the Core Model on how INDIA should be converted into a right wing Hindu Dominated Nation was experimented ( even on how to eliminate or displace a large number of Muslims from a place through the 2002 riots) successfully in Gujarat! GUJARAT was also utilized by Modi-Amit Shah NEXUS on how to eliminate political opponents even within their own party BJP. It was during that important period from 2000-'13,  just before the Parliament Election in 2014 before Modi became the PM, all the various cruelty and threats like top police officers being framed with fake cases and imprisoned and even eliminating firm and just judicial officers have been successfully practiced by the Modi-Shah nexus in Gujarat..!! He also experimented and successfully implemented the most important thing in Modi's success in winning the National Elections continuously for the 3rd Time! That novel idea was the new  way of creating wealth for his political party & it's supportive organisations through creating a few Benami Billionaires and channelizing the wealth of the state of GUJARAT through huge favouristic policies shown to the BENAMI Billionaires!Those BENAMI Billionaires are now the core providers of  money for creating all the political turmoils, campaigns and manipulations like splitting existing political parties and buying political leaders through horse trading and thus toppling state Govts. (eg. Maharashtra) as well as resources needed  for the huge logistical & resource intensive operations to create millions of fake Voter ID's & then using, a certain no. of trusted professional fake voters to cast votes by transporting them physically from one place to other even crossing states and thus manipulating the entire ELECTION process in INDIA! The illegitimately conquered Political Power at the Centre through fake election wins! This is the most dangerous situation for the hard earned Democracy of INDIA to survive!
It is so disgraceful and pathetic that a Great writer and winner of the Booker Price like Arundhathi Roy had to think of even leaving INDIA and live abroad because of the severe THREAT she experiences on a daily basis just because she is expressing her opinions bravely. suppliers of  helping th implemented experimented and practiced   and most importantly a revenue model on how to help grow some existing billionaires & also create some new Benami Billionaires! And using them as the wealth creating machines for the Party..!
It is so painful to hear and watch the dangers a great writer and a winner of the prestigious Booker Prize., like Arundhati Roy had to face & still facing to survive & live in INDIA..!! It seems that a second freedom struggle will be needed for Indians to regain the beautiful days prior to 2014 with peace, harmony, freedom and true Democracy!
Let the opposition alliance named the INDIA Alliance and its constituent parties iron off their differences & join hands to regain our freedom & true Democracy! Jai Hind!🙏🇮🇳❤️

However, they did disagree regarding the permissibility of acts of kindness towards them in releasing them in return for money or them offering up themselves. … Ibn ‘Abbas said: The meaning of His word { Until the war puts down its burdens } is: Until none of the Idolaters are left; Mujahid said: Until there is no religion but Islam. … The meaning of this verse then is: Exhaust the Idolaters by killing and imprisonment until Islam prevails over all religions.

India in general is a large country. Something happens to someone everyday. That everyday occurrence applies to Hindus as well as other minorities. 

She gets recognized and awarded by foreign establishment and she is simply advancing their agendas.

She needs to support her claim on mass killings. You know when they used to happen on a daily basis in some part of India or other? Before the current Government. 

The bulldozing she is referring to is illegal living quarters that people have built that have travelled into India illegally. 

She is one of those who seeks attention and Validation by seemingly talking in favor of Muslims and other minorities as a Hindu. “Oh look how Great I am”.

The fact that she has been living in India and still alive after all these years of advertising India in bad light for so long…..is proof in itself that India is indeed safe. 

There are so many opposers of the current Government spewing Venom on daily a basis and nothing has happened to them. They are just frustrated that their agenda isn’t working.

Then Congress allowed Naxals, Bodo militants, Khalistanis, Maoists, other Muslim anti-national organizations to thrive and get stronger. At least after the Modi government came power trying hard to get rid of those anti-nationals. This is not going to happen overnight. Then there is so much domestic violence, criminals creating ruckus, some activities purposely manufactured by political interests like Maratha Reservations in Maharashtra and many more. 
So in a diverse country like India one will always hear some news. But for most population life goes on without trouble.

Dv_BmSx83bw,@Salam.Pottengal,"I am from Kerala. I read The God of Small Things in 1997 when I was in Dubai. A friend of mine gave me the book, which she had temporarily picked up from her European boss’s bookshelf for me. Before that, I had read an exciting article, I believe in India Today magazine, just before the book’s launch while I was on vacation in India. After reading that exhilarating article about the new novel and its beautiful author, I was eagerly waiting to get my hands on it. At that time, it wasn’t as easy as it is today to get a newly published book right away.Since then, I have read all of Arundhati Roy’s essays, mostly in Outlook, Frontline, and The Guardian. I longed to read more of her novels, but to no avail. Then The Ministry of Utmost Happiness came out, and I bought it as soon as it was published. Arundhati, as a person, has always filled my mind with amazement. Now that I’ve finished reading Mother Mary Comes to Me, so many dots about my dear writer have been connected, and I feel a sense of completeness and joyful sorrow in my heart. I now see why her novels didn't flow each year. Love her.",03/10/25 14:15

She is so accessible and her writing and life is so relatable. While writing a long essay about my mother early this year echoes similar sentiments.,03/10/25 11:01

Arundhati Roy and Parvathy’s conversation about the book was engaging. But if you look closely at how the dialogue flowed, there’s a contrast in how each views activism.

Parvathy often speaks with a sense of pride — positioning herself as someone who has saved women actors in Mollywood. Her tone carries a celebratory note, almost as if activism is a badge of honour.

Arundhati, on the other hand, frames it very differently. For her, activism isn’t about being fearless, heroic, or earning applause. She says it comes from a place of vulnerability — from feeling the pain of being sidelined, and recognizing that those unheard voices need space. It isn’t about likes, followers, or building a strong public persona. It’s about responding to an inner, genuine need to stand with those who are silenced.

That’s where the distinction lies. Arundhati’s activism feels rooted in empathy and lived experience, while Parvathy’s, at times, seems a bit over the top — more about projecting strength than holding space for others.",02/10/25 15:37

I'm not fluent enough in Malayalam to understand a conversation of this calibre if it happened in Malayalam so that linguistic disadvantage I've had my whole life has been my loss. But with this conversation in English, it's my first time (in my 59 years) to partake, as an audience member, in a discussion between two people who are so like me culturally. Arundhati Roy is someone I've deeply, deeply admired for the last almost 30 years, for both her writing and for her activism. I had only fleetingly heard of Parvathy Thiruvothu (in the context of the Hema Committee Report) and now am so impressed with her depth -- and so delighted to discover it too. There are so many insights I gained from this conversation, such as that little nugget about women in Kerala not knowing what to do with their financial independence because of not having personal goals (which rang true to me). And I appreciated Arundhati Roy's perspective on cancel culture as I do unfortunately tend to avoid/walk away from people who don't share my values -- call it self-preservation but there is some cowardice in it too for sure. It gives me such hope for women in Kerala that there are role models like Parvathy Thiruvothu for young women to aspire to. Arundhati Roy is of course the role model for role models. I look forward to listening to more such conversations between minds like theirs. <3",02/09/25 01:55

It seems based on her books like Capitalism- a ghost story that she is against the free market economy in itself. At the same time, she calls herself a liberal. I might be factually wrong in describing her views and feel free to correct me. If the above described views are correct, then may God help India ! We need genuine liberals to combat abuse of power. What is a genuine liberal ? A genuine liberal believes that liberty is an important value in itself, not a means to a further end. He/she believes that economic freedom goes hand in hand with civic rights. That one cannot protect any rights without defending liberty in all its aspects- liberty of religious opinion, freedom of speech and writing etc. cannot be defended if all printing presses and paper mills are nationalised and given over to the government. Such a state of affairs leads to freedom in name only. She says that free trade creates economic inequality. She conveniently ignores the liberalization of the indian economy by Mr. Narsimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh and the ensuing green and white revolutions in agriculture and milk production. Amul was a child of that liberalization. All the comments section is full of praise for the lady. Nobody dares to criticise her except some hindu conservatives who do it rather badly.
